## Description
Working in a small group we were given the opportunity to create and develop a full-stack web-application of our choosing.

The project had to include the following: 
- MVC Paradigm 
- Create server-side API
- User Authentication 
- Connect to MySQL Database
- A new technology not included in course content 
- Be responsive 
- Be deployed on GitHub
- Be deployed on Heroku 
- Have a clean repository that meet quality coding standards
- Have a quality README 

Our motivation was to make an application that highlighted all the skills and knowledge we have learnt so far in our web-development journey.

## Installation
Once the user has cloned the project from GitHub there are a few steps they must undertake in order to get the application running.

Youâ€™ll need to open the command terminal and input 'npm install' to install all the neccessary dependencies. 

Use the `schema.sql` file in the `db` folder to create your database with MySQL shell commands. To create the database you need to open the terminal command line (in the DB folder)  Use environment variables to store sensitive data like your MySQL username, password, and database name.

Once the schema has been established, you need to 'seed' the database. 
This is done by running  `npm run seed` to seed data to your database so that you can test your routes.

Once the seeds have been executed create the code needed in `server.js` to sync the Sequelize models to the MySQL database on server start.
